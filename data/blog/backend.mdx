Choosing a service to store data can be confusing and overwhelming for a front-end developer.
What are all these acronyms? Are the Amazon services named strange on purpose? These and many other questions
await your journey into the back-end.

As a front-end developer turned full-stack, I've spent more time than I'd like to admit trying to figure out the backend.
Because the backend is harder to _visualize_, I struggled to understand how the pieces fit together. Luckily, I soon found
out I wasn't alone. There's a support group when confused front-end engineers meet called Twitter.

Consider this article a "choose your own adventure" piece. I'll ask questions about your requirements
and then present a few options. Before we can begin our journey, I must first explain the basics. You can
also jump to the [list of services](/blog/backend#list-of-services) directly.

`console.log('Hello World!)`

```
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```

## Backend Basics

What is this scary place, **the back-end?** You can boil it down to this:

- You need a place to store data ([database](https://dataguide.prisma.io/intro/what-are-databases))
- You need a method of retrieving the data ([API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface))

As a front-end engineer, you've probably worked with APIs before. They allow you to fetch data from some database, somewhere.
On a long enough timeline, you'll eventually need to build your own API or
work with an existing codebase that has a back-end. This brings us to our first question.
