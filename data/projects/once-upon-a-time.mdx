Once Upon a Time had taken five years to make, firstly by training Palestinian youth
on the art of interviewing elders in their villages and local area. Over three summers
we trained 60 youth and equipped them with the skills and equipment to interview
elders in their village thus engaging them in the process of creation. The result
is 60 hours of interviews of over 100 elders from 50 villages across Palestine.
