Once Upon a Time had taken five years to make, firstly by training Palestinian youth on the art
of interviewing elders in their villages and local area. Over three summers we trained 60 youth
and equipped them with the skills and equipment to interview elders in their village thus
engaging them in the process of creation. The result is 60 hours of interviews of over 100
elders from 50 villages across Palestine.

The Virtual Reality Documentary is a journey through a pre 1948 Palestinian village and the old
city of Jerusalem, once you put on the headset you are immediately transported into a 3D
reconstructed village as you click on object true to life storytellers will tell you stories inspired
by the interviews collected by the youth.

The Augmented Reality Documentary complements this experience by allowing you to browse
through an album of old photos from Palestine and experience the same stories but now in
context to the images and the elders who told that story.

The Interactive Web Documentary allows the users to watch a selected set of those interviews
classified by categories of tradition, music, food, and location
