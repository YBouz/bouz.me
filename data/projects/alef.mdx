## What is Alef?

Alef 3D is a web-based enterprise platform that is fully capable of providing solutions
for a variety of industries and use-cases. Alef provides a ‘single source of truth’
by providing a digital twin for remote viewing and collaboration across both internal
and external stakeholders. The core functionality of the platform lies in the ability
to easily capture any space and create digital twins of the real built world. After
the capture, a virtual tour is generated with the primary purpose of showcasing the
real world assets in 4K quality and engaging an immersive virtual experience.

Alef serves as the central platform for managing several entities coming from different industries
and with different feature requirements and needs. Each entity operating on the platform can maintain
and manage a set of their own personal assets.
