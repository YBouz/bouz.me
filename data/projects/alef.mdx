## What is Alef?

Alef 3D is a web-based enterprise platform that is fully capable of providing solutions
for a variety of industries and use-cases. Alef VR provides a ‘single source of truth’
by providing a digital twin for remote viewing and collaboration across both internal
and external stakeholders. The core functionality of the platform lies in the ability
to easily capture any space and create digital twins of the real built world. After
the capture, a virtual tour is generated with the primary purpose of showcasing the
real world assets in 4K quality and engaging an immersive virtual experience.

Our secure platform provides virtual tours with an intuitive and unique user experience where the corresponding
possibilities are limitless. The virtual tour is fully capable of verification and measurements due to the 3D
capture equipment containing embedded LIDAR laser scanners which create accurate measurements to within a 1%
margin of error to reality. The virtual tour is also completely Virtual Reality (VR) enabled, and capable of
rendering a VR experience with a VR headset such as the Oculus Go or Oculus Quest.

Beyond that, there are many industry-specific features and solutions the platform is capable of delivering.
For starters, any enterprise client would require white-label for their product, which Alef VR is capable
of delivering. Default feature sets such as the map view, grid view and list view, filtering capability by
property type, property area, etc. The map view will contain pins of the properties managed on the platform
at their respective locations, with a display of a 3D model of the property, and on click will display a UI
popup with the respective property information, link to edit and customize the property, and another link
to view the 3D virtual tour. Furthermore, there are features specific to the retail industry where our
platform can help a shopping store set up an online e-commerce shop (i.e. ‘v-commerce store’ or ‘v-store’)
of any of their stores or products as a method to generate additional revenue with an integrated virtual
shopping experience. There are also features specific to the real-estate industry that could help with
showcases and asset management including virtual staging, appointment scheduling, task management and
video calling for remote viewings.

Thus, Alef serves as the central platform for managing several entities coming from different industries
and with different feature requirements and needs. Each entity operating on the platform can maintain
and manage a set of their own personal assets.
